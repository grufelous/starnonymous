# Starnonymous
###### Name subject to changes

## Introduction
Starnonymous is an anonymous internet board for you to broadcast your deepest thoughts out loud. This projects seeks to let you freely talk about what is bothering you, about things that typically do not make it into everyday talk, about what drives you and what scares you. 
It is not by any means meant as a forum for bullying, spreading hate, or invoking fear in anyone. I hope the community does not take this project for performing such offences.

## Inspiration
Last year, I came across a project in CMoC - which, loosely, is Cluster Innovation Center's own version of GSoC - with the same ideals. The said project is live at https://skyofthoughts.github.io. Moved by the same, I took the challenge of learning and developing a similar platform. The developers of Sky Of Thoughts are @jervis446 and @iashris, from what is apparent in the commit logs.
I started this project to apply my theoretical knowledge of Django alongside jQuery & good ol' vanilla JS, all backed by plain HTML and CSS. No part of this project uses the code of SkyOfThoughts - both have been developed independently.

## Techstack used
Django 2.1.5
jQuery
Bootstrap
Basic Three of Web Dev - Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS

## Future prospects
Stricter sanitation of inputs
A smoother UX
Better styled UI
Possible addition of AJAX
Combination with Angular and/or React to study those technologies
